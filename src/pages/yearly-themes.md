title: Yearly Themes
---

My friend Elias and I have been picking [yearly themes](https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE) on our podcast [since 2018](https://breadcrumbs.fm/69/). Starting in 2020, I'm recording those here. For reference/posterity.

## 2020: The Year of Regeneration

*Allowing the things that need to to die and finding new life*

- [Breadcrumbs episode](https://breadcrumbs.fm/163/)
- [Blog post](/2020/regeneration/)

### Ideal Outcomes

- A renewed closeness to God fed by spiritual disciplines
- A better work-rest balance in which I work well *and* rest well
- A clear contribution to the regeneration of the church
- A healthier financial situation and relationship to spending
