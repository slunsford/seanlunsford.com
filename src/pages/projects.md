I’m a serial starter of side projects.

- Here at [seanlunsford.com](/) is my rarely-updated blog—generally about [matters of faith](/category/christianity) or [more personal goings-on](/category/life), but occasionally about [nerdy stuff like code or Apple devices](/category/technology). For a while I had another site for that, ~~but *two* rarely-updated blogs seemed like overkill.~~ *(See below –Ed.)* The [colophon](/colophon/) has more technical details about the site.
- [Diapers & Coffee](https://diapers.coffee/) is my parenting microblog.
- I post my photography over on [Glass](https://glass.photo/seanlunsford) (and before that, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/splunsford/)).
- [Breadcrumbs](https://breadcrumbsfm.com/) was my podcast with [my friend Elias](https://twitter.com/muffinworks), on indefinite hiatus. You can find it on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/breadcrumbs/id1141684029), [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/itunes1141684029/breadcrumbs), [Castro](https://castro.fm/podcast/f7168909-66c3-4e32-af6f-fc7d291a048f), [Pocket Casts](http://pca.st/itunes/1141684029), or wherever podcasts are sold. Maybe we’ll collaborate on something again someday.
