I’m a digital nomad currently based in Antalya, Türkiye, with my wife, daughter, and a son on the way. I’m an [adult TCK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid) who spent eight years back in the US (four in college; four after) before [returning to Asia](/2018/eleven-days/).

I’m an [analytics engineer](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering#what-is-an-analytics-engineer) for a US homebuilder—a position I’ve been in for just over a year as we modernize our data stack and replace myriad Excel reports with new dashboards. I’ve been at this company for more than ten years but the past year has been the most enthusiastic and engaged I’ve been in my work yet.

I enjoy the intersection of technology and creativity, with a trail of [current and past projects](/projects/) to show for it. I’ve done photography and videography—as a [hobby](/2023/365/) and as a [side gig](https://lunsford.tech/). I had a [podcast](https://breadcrumbsfm.com/) for more than 4 years. I’ve been running sound for church and occasionally other live events since college. I taught myself the basics of web development in middle school, and recently [rebuilt this website](https://github.com/slunsford/seanlunsford.com) on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).[^blog]

[^blog]: Before that, it was a self-hosted [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blog, and before that, [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/).
