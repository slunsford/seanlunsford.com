I’m a digital nomad currently based in Antalya, Türkiye, with my wife, daughter, and son. I’m an [ATCK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid) who spent eight years back in the United States (four in college; four after) before [returning to Asia](/2018/eleven-days/).

## Work

I’m an [analytics engineer](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering#what-is-an-analytics-engineer) for a US homebuilder—a position I’ve been in for a couple years, working to modernize our data stack and replace myriad Excel reports with new dashboards. I’ve been at this company for a decade now, but this role has brought me the most enthusiasm in my work yet.

## Interests

I enjoy the intersection of technology and creativity, with a trail of [current and past projects](/projects/) to show for it. I’m into photography and videography—as a [hobby](/2023/365/) and as a [side gig](https://lunsford.tech/). I had a [podcast](https://breadcrumbs.fm) that lasted 4 years. I’ve been running sound for church and occasionally other live events since college. I taught myself the basics of web development in middle school and have continued to code ever since—including the current and previous versions of this blog.
