A couple of well-known verses have been on my mind since my post, “[Setting things straight](/2013/02/09/setting-things-straight/)”:

> What good is it, dear brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but don’t show it by your actions? Can that kind of faith save anyone? Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing, and you say, “Good-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well”—but then you don’t give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do?
> 
> So you see, faith by itself isn’t enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless.
> 
> James 2:14-17

> If I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels, but didn’t love others, I would only be a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God’s secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn’t love others, I would be nothing. If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it; but if I didn’t love others, I would have gained nothing.
> 
> 1 Corinthians 13:1-3

Faith without deeds is dead; faith and deeds without love are nothing.

> Three things will last forever—faith, hope, and love—and the greatest of these is love.
> 
> 1 Corinthians 13:13
