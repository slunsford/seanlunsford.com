The first thought of starting a blog came to me over a year ago. God spoke to me a couple different times, within a few weeks of each other, specifically showing me things that were meant to be shared. They ended up as notes on Facebook. But it got me thinking. What I really wanted to do was code the site from the ground up myself, as well as write the posts. It was a cool way to bring together two interests of mine. But being an engineering major, I just don’t have the time to do both. And so the idea ended up on a back burner for well over a year, coming to mind once in a while, but as something that I would just have to do one day when I have time to do it.

Then yesterday, a friend suggested I start a blog—as far as I know, having no idea that it was something I’d wanted to do for a while. The heavens opened, a shaft of light came down, angelic choir and all. Not really…but that comment was enough to make me decide to finally do this. I realized that not having time to build my own website for this didn’t have to mean I don’t do the writing part. WordPress was a good compromise. This way I can use an existing framework, and do as much or as little coding as I want or have time for on top of said existing framework. I may as well use the services that plenty of other people use so that what time I have (or make) can be focused on actually writing stuff.

Which brought up a question. *Does this universe really need one more blog?* It’s so easy to start a blog. Anyone can do it. The blogosphere is the place to be these days. And I’ve never been one to follow the crowd. And I don’t really want to be one more voice on the already bloated Internet. Which is why I’m going to try not to post just for the sake of posting. I have no idea how regularly I’m going to post here, but I’d rather write far less frequently, and only write things that people actually think are worth reading. (And hopefully I’ll be a good judge of that.)

Finally, there was the issue of a title. Or lack thereof. I spent a good deal of time trying to come up with some creative name for the blog. Something that would convey what this blog is going to be about. The problem with that is, *I’m* not entirely sure what all this blog will be about at this point. Certainly—primarily, I should say—thoughts about my faith and things God is showing me. But being a TCK (third culture kid) whose family is still living overseas, traversing the globe has been a huge part of my past, and is definitely in my future, and is bound to present plenty of things to share here. Not to mention anything else that comes up that I think the world needs to hear. Almost any name I choose could prove to be limiting in the future, as this blog progresses and evolves. And what names I could come up with that seemed to do the trick were already taken. Besides, I learned years ago in the realm of email addresses that what sounds really cool one year may not seem quite so cool a few years down the road. But you can’t go wrong with your own name.

So there you have it. I have officially entered the blogosphere. Hopefully I’m not just adding to the noise.
