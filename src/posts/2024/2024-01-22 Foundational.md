Another year, [another theme](/tag/yearly-themes/). (We’re not out of January yet.)

I had an idea of what I was going for with my theme for 2024, but the name remained elusive right up until the first week of the new year. The word that was coming to mind for a while was *[refactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)*. I was planning to spend (and am now spending) most of Q1 refactoring our [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/product/what-is-dbt) codebase. It needs to be rewritten to be cleaner and clearer; easier to understand, work with, and debug; better tested and much better documented (read: documented at all). I could think of a number of other things that this could apply to—clearing and organizing my office, for instance.

“The Year of Refactoring” doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue though.
