Over the last many months I’ve been looking a lot into the subject I just wrote about. I’ve read a lot of what other people had to say. Some of them had some of the same ideas I do, but said them a lot better than I could. I thought it would be helpful to compile a short list of articles and blog posts that I’ve read and found thought-provoking. **This is not a 100% endorsement of everything on these pages,** but I think some good points were made, and I hope they, along with my post, can give you some food for thought.
