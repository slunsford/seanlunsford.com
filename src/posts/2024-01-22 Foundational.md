Another year, [another theme](/tag/yearly-themes/). It’s taken me a few weeks to get this written, but we’re not out of January *yet*.

My 2024 theme remained elusive right up until the first week of the new year, even though I’d had a rough idea of where I was going with it for some time. The word that was coming to mind for a while was *[refactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)*. I was planning to spend (and am now spending) most of Q1 refactoring our [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/product/what-is-dbt) codebase at work. It needs to be rewritten to be cleaner and clearer; easier to understand, work with, and debug; better tested and much better documented *(read: documented at all)*. I could also think of a number of other things that the idea of a refactor could apply to—clearing and organizing my office, to name one. “The Year of Refactoring” didn’t really grab me, though, and it doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue. So I kept sitting on it.

In a conversation at the beginning of January about our data stack and roadmap for it, my manager asked me what I would consider success this year. I thought of the refactor and of the development to come and replied that, regardless of how many new dashboards are completed this year, I’m aiming for a solid foundation on which to build into the future. After that exchange, that word—**foundation**—stuck with me, and I knew I’d found it. The *Year of Foundations* captures much of what I’ve been thinking about going into a new year.

I want to lay groundwork in a number of areas to prepare me, my work, and my family for whatever is coming in the future. With much uncertainty in my family’s short- and long-term outlook, I want to focus on building stability in the things we *can* control, setting us up to weather the unpredictable.

In the personal/administrative area, I’ve always been quick to hop between task management apps (or analog systems), email apps and services, note-taking apps…you get the idea. There’s always something that’s not quite working for me with whatever I’m using, and the grass is greener somewhere else—maybe on something new or maybe back on something I was using before switching to the greener pastures of what I’m dissatisfied with now.[^switching] I think this year would be a great time to pick tools that will serve me for the foreseeable future, get my systems dialed in with them, and then let them get out of the way so I can use the tools to do the work instead of working on the tools (as much fun as that can be). Not saying that’s what’s going to happen this year—but it’d be great if it did.

Speaking of tools and migrations, this website has just been rebuilt on [a new foundation](/colophon/). That migration happened over the holidays after working on it off and on for several months, and [my last post](/2023/365/) was the first to be published on the new system. This is now [the third platform](/2018/seanlunsford-com-has-moved/) this blog has lived on in its twelve years of existence, and I’m hopeful it will serve me for years to come.

Finally, at the risk of sounding corny, I want to attend to the two most important foundations in my life: my foundation on Jesus, and the foundation of my marriage. Both have suffered at the hand of busyness—between parenting, work, and any number of other things. I want to consider ways to be more intentional about those in the coming year.

==Conclusion==

[^switching]: I do think there can be a place for that; there is some sense in picking a tool for the level of complexity or simplicity needed in that season—but every time there is also a switching cost, as tasks, notes, or emails and server records need to be migrated from one platform to another.
