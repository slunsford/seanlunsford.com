I just came across [this draft](2024/sql-to-a-python-fight/) from September, in which I not only wrote a post about some recreational coding/data analysis, but made a bunch of updates to my website to better handle code and tables. Instead of updating and publishing it now, I decided to [pull a Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/07/long-lost-df-post?ref=seanlunsford.com) and back-date it to when it was basically done and just never published.\[^fn\]

\[^fn\]: In my case, though, it’s not as if it’s getting buried under 11 years of prolific writing. It’s literally the post right below this one.
