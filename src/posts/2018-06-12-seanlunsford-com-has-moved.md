I’ve just finished [the move I wrote about](/2018/eleven-days/),[^1] so it seems appropriate to officially announce the move of my blog as well, though this new site has been live for a while now.

I’ve been using WordPress since my first post went up on this blog in 2012, but when I launched [my other site](https://thedarkroast.com) in 2014 it was using a blogging platform called [Ghost](https://ghost.org) and hosted on a server I rent and manage. Pretty much since then I’ve wanted to migrate this blog to Ghost and consolidate both on that same server. But in the past several months I’ve finally made the transition piecemeal, as I’ve had a moment here or there: migrating the old posts and images to a new instance of Ghost, pointing the seanlunsford.com domain name at the new site (and reverting WordPress to the wordpress.com subdomain), and coding a new theme.[^2]

The final piece was setting up email subscriptions with Ghost’s subscribers functionality and [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com). I didn’t have this last piece in place when I published my last post, so I pushed it live to both sites at the same time. Sometime last week I took a break from moving to get the email piece up and running and migrate email subscribers from the old site,[^3] so I can now say that the move is complete.

I do have aspirations of starting to write more often again.[^4] So if you want to know when there’s something new, you can get it in your [inbox](/subscribe/) or [RSS reader](/feed.xml).

[^1]: Except for those couple pieces of luggage the airline should be bringing by sometime today.

[^2]: I have to say I really like the way it turned out. I used [the theme](https://thedarkroast.com/arabica/) I created and maintain for The Dark Roast as a foundation, but made some visual changes and took cues from what I liked best in my customized WordPress theme.

[^3]: Tinkering with servers and RSS feeds is a nice change from putting stuff into suitcases, boxes, and trash bags.
