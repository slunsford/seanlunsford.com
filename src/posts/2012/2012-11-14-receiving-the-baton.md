“Reblogging” is something that I haven’t done here yet, that I’ve decided to experiment with—linking on my blog to other great blog posts I read around the web. There’s so much great stuff out there that gets me thinking or impacts me, and rather than reinventing the wheel, it makes sense to just point you to what they’ve already said, better than I can, and add a few comments of my own.

Since I’ve been reading *Confessions of a Caffeinated Christian* again this past week (by the way, I said I was on track to finish it in a week, and sure enough, I read the last two chapters today) I discovered that John Fischer also has a WordPress blog. I’ve appreciated the things I’ve read there these past several days as I’ve been following it. This one got me really excited, because I agree wholeheartedly. Hebrews 11, up through the first several verses of chapter 12, is among my favorite passages of the Bible. The idea that is painted of a relay race is one that I can relate to from my days on the track team, and one that I have pointed to a lot in discussing our piece of the bigger picture. [Here are Fischer’s thoughts on it.](https://catchjohnfischer.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/receiving-the-baton/) Enjoy.
