So I’ve started writing for NLCF’s website. Traditionally it’s the staff who write, but they want to get a few others writing regularly, to kind of get a broader perspective on what God’s doing in the congregation (either by writing about what God’s up to in our own lives, or by sharing stories of other people.) So I volunteered. I’m scheduled for three dates this semester, each about three weeks apart. [Here’s the first one.](https://www.nlcf.net/latest-news/blog/in-over-my-head/)
